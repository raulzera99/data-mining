Feature correlating with price_range 

There is a strong correlation between ram and price_range. 

price_range has a low correlation value with the rest of the features, but this cannot be used as a criterion to remove these features since the pearson correlation only expresses the linear relationship between two variables. 

We can see a moderate correlation between 4G and 3G, fc and pc, px_height and px_width, sc_h and sc_w.
